#### SEO Title

Before V1.4, site setting `title` is not only used for displayed in Home Page and Navbar, but also used to generate the `<title>` in HTML.
It's possible that you want the two things different. For me, my site-title is **“ZeFeng Blog”** but I want the title shows in search engine is **“陈泽锋的博客 | ZeFeng Blog”** which is multi-language.

So, the SEO Title is introduced to solve this problem, you can set `SEOTitle` different from `title`, and it would be only used to generate HTML `<title>` and setting DuoShuo Sharing.
